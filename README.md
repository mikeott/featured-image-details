# Featured Image Details (WordPress)

This WordPress plugin simply adds a new button next to the featured image that gives you quick access to the image details. I intially wrote this plugin for personal use, but have decided to share it for the benefit of madkind :-)

The image details returned are:

  - Width
  - Height
  - File path
  - Camere model
  - Focal length
  - ISO
  - Shutter speed
  - Aperture
  - Timestamp

**Note: This WordPress plugin comes with absolutelty no warranty of any kind. Although it has passed my own testing on a handful of websites, using it is at your own risk. Always backup your database first, just in case.**
